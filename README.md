Printf.
int printf ( const char * format, ... );
This is the first group project that we have at ALX africa which consists of replicating the printf (3) function of language c, calling it this way _printf.

This function is part of the standard library and to use it we must specify the header file <stdio.h>.

Writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output (stdout). If format includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.

The tasks.
-[x] I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life. Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype:int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers: -- c -- s -- %
-[x] Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't Handle the following conversion specifiers: -- d --i

Functions we use.
int _putchar(char c); /*writes the character c to stdout */
int _printf(const char *format, ...);/* function that produces output according to a format.*/
int print_char(va_list c);/*writes the character c to stdout */
int print_string(va_list s);/*writes the character c to stdout */
int print_int(va_list i);/*function that prints an integer */
int print_dec(va_list d);/* function that prints an decimal*/

### Complilation
All of the ``.c`` files along with a main.c file are to be compiled with ``gcc 4.8.4`` on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with the flags ``-Wall Werror`` ``-Westra`` and ``-pedantic.``

The files will be compiled this way:
- ``gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c``
